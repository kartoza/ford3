## Quick Installation Guide

For deployment we use [docker](http://docker.com) so you need to have docker 
running on the host. Ford3 is a django app so it will help if you have
some knowledge of running a django site.

### Clone

```
git clone git://github.com/kartoza/ford3.git
cd ford3
```

- We will use Makefile script available under deployment folder.
- Any `make` commands should be run under deployment folder.

### Build
```
cd deployment
cp btsync-db.env.EXAMPLE btsync-db.env
cp btsync-media.env.EXAMPLE btsync-media.env
make build
make permissions
```

### Docker
```
cd deployment/ansible/development/group_vars
cp all.sample.yml all.yml
```

- edit `all.yml` line 4 (*use_pycharm*), line 6 (*remote_user*), 8 (*remote_group*), and 10 (*project_path*) in all.yml accordingly
  - make sure that *remote_user* is equal to your local user
  - *remote_group* is likely stay the same if using linux and macOS
  - *project_path* is equal to `/home/web/ford3`

```
cd deployment/ansible
mkdir tmp
cd ..
make setup-ansible
```
Choose your pycharm version from the list or hit Enter if you don't use pycharm.


```
make up
```
Wait 30 seconds for the database to be started.

```
make migrate
make collectstatic
```

### Add superuser
```
make superuser
```

### Add initial data (occupations, subjects, interests, groups, provinces, SAQA qualifications)
```
make load-initial-data
```

### Run a server through PyCharm (skip if you don't use PyCharm)
- Open PyCharm
- Notice your pycharm, there should be *Ford3* django server in the toolbar.
  - Wait for a couple of minutes. Make sure the PyCharm has loaded all the necessary files.
  - If pycharm requires to install additional supported modules, click on the provided link
- Click on the `play button` or `debug button` next to *Ford3* instance in the toolbar. The pycharm will run the server for you
  - sometimes restart pycharm can remedy the problem too
  - If the server doesn't run, try:

```
make down
make up
```


### Run a server from a container
```
make up
make shell
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Browse

Open your favorite browser and go to: `http://localhost`

## Useful tools for development

###  Coding style

**flake8** is used to make sure the code is aligned with coding style.

```
make flake8
```


### Selenium and django tests

#### Selenium IDE
 In order to run the selenium tests, make sure you have [https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/](Selenium IDE) installed.

 The tests assume the existence of an user with the following credentials:
 - email: admin@admin.com
 - password: admin

 Otherwise, create one with:
 ```
 cd deployment
 make superuser
 ```

 In Selenium IDE, choose the project `selenium-ide/OpenEdu.side` and execute the test suite `Default Suite`. Tests will fail if you run them individually.

 Before running the tests, you must start a local server.
 
#### Django tests
 ```
 cd deployment
 make test
 ```


## Miscellaneous

### Backups

If you don't need backups, you can let the default content.

If you wish to sync backups, you need to establish a read / write btsync 
key on your production server and run one or more btsync clients 
with a read only key.

```
cd deployment
cp btsync-media.env.EXAMPLE btsync-media.env
cp btsync-db.env.EXAMPLE btsync-db.env
```

Now edit the ``btsync-media.env`` and ``btsync-db.env`` files, including 
relevant SECRET and DEVICE settings.

### Render a graphical overview of the app's models

```
cd deployment
make shell
apt-get install graphviz
pip install django-extensions graphviz pyparsing pydot pygraphviz
./manage.py graph_models --pygraphviz -a -g -o openedu_models.png --exclude-models Session,AbstractBaseSession,PostGISSpatialRefSys,PostGISGeometryColumns,EmailConfirmation,SocialToken,LogEntry,EmailAddress,SocialAccount,SocialApp,Site,ContentType
```
